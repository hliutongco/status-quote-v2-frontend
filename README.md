# Status Quote

![status quote](./example.png)

Status Quote is a one-player game where you guess famous movie lines.

The first version of this game was an entry in the 2018 New York AT&T Entertainment Hackathon and was created within one day by a team of four people.

This second version includes the following additions:

* A new voice-activated start menu with instructions
* A revamped point system
* A hint button
* Transitions between scenes

### Instructions

Upon starting the game, a series of video clips will play one after another. These videos contain famous scenes from movies.

At a certain point, each video clip will pause. At this point, the player has 10 seconds to guess the next line in the scene. Say your guess out loud and stand close enough for your device's microphone to pick up your answer.

You receive two points for each correct guess. However, you only get one point if you choose to receive a hint. Good luck!
